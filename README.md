-	The average temperature in December is roughly 3.9 degrees lower than the average temperature in July.
-	The lowest temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than June’s lowest temperature.
-	The highest temperature in December is 2 degrees lower than June’s highest temperature. 

## Summary
Since the difference in temperature between June and December is slim, we are confident that W’Avy’s business is sustainable all year round. Just to be sure about our conclusion, we also ran two additional queries on precipitation statistics for June and December. This provided us with the following results:

Like the temperature data, the difference between the two months is extremely slim. This is more proof that W.Avy’s business is sustainable all year round at this location.
